# B12. Given a natural number n. Find the Fibonachi number f(n).
# Create and use a function to calculate the Fibonachi number f(n).
# (Fibonachi numbers are f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), t. i. f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5 utt.).
# Also, check if the given number n is a Fibonachi number.
# Create and use a function for this check.
# Program created at: 2021/26.03

# A recursive function finds the nth Fibonacci term.
# It checks the entered number and returns the sum of the two previous numbers in
# the Fibonacci sequence, if the number is not smaller or equal to 1 (0 and 1 ar the first two Fibonacci numbers)

# A function checks, if the entered number is a Fibonacci number.
# It starts with 0 and 1, since those are the first two Fibonacci numbers.
# They are added to each other to get their Fibonacci number.
# Then a while loop is executed, which stops only when the variable "next" is not smaller than the input number.
# In each iteration the variables are assigned a new value thus incrementing the initial
# number and getting to the next term in the Fibonacci sequence.
# If next (each Fibonacci number) is equal to the input number, the input number IS a Fibonacci number.
# If not, it is NOT a Fibonacci number.
